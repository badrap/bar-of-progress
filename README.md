A small, easy & zero-dependency progress bar component.

## Features

- **Zero dependencies**: Also not tied to any framework in particular.
- **Small size**: < 500 bytes with Brotli (< 600 bytes gzipped).
- **Easy to use**: Just a couple of lines and off you go. And TypeScript types are now available as well!

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i @badrap/bar-of-progress
```

## Usage

Import the package and create a progress bar instance:

```js
import ProgressBar from "@badrap/bar-of-progress";

const progress = new ProgressBar();
```

Show the progress bar and begin animating it by calling the `.start()` method. 

```js
progress.start();
```

> **Note**
> By default the progress bar does not appear immediately when `.start()` is called. Instead there is a 80 millisecond grace period, allowing very quickly completed tasks to avoid showing the progress bar. You can modify this (and other) behavior, see [Customization](#customization).

End the progress bar animation by calling the `.finish()` method:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  progress.finish();
}, 1000);
```

You can reuse a `progress` instance multiple times - every time `.start()` gets called the progress bar starts animation from scratch.

## Customization

The progress bar's appearance and behavior can be (slightly) customized with constructor parameters. Here are the different options and their default values:

```js
const progress = new ProgressBar({
  // The size (height) of the progress bar.
  // Numeric values get converted to px.
  size: 2,

  // Color of the progress bar.
  // Also used for the glow around the bar.
  color: "#29e",

  // Class name used for the progress bar element.
  className: "bar-of-progress",

  // How many milliseconds to wait before the progress bar
  // animation starts after calling .start().
  delay: 80,
});
```
